      "gt_answer": "The Nile is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa and has historically been considered the longest river in the world, though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer. Of the world's major rivers, the Nile is one of the smallest, as measured by annual flow in cubic metres of water. About 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt.",
      "response": "The longest river in the world is the Nile, stretching approximately 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles) through northeastern Africa, flowing through countries such as Uganda, Sudan, and Egypt before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea. There is some debate about this title, as recent studies suggest the Amazon River could be longer if its longest tributaries are included, potentially extending its length to about 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles).",
